ðŸ§© Problem: Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)

LeetCode #75 â€” Medium

Question:
You are given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue â€” represented by 0, 1, and 2.
Sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, in the order red â†’ white â†’ blue (0, 1, 2).

Example:

Input:  nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Constraint: You cannot use a library sort function.
ðŸ’¡ Hint (donâ€™t code yet):
Try using three pointers â€” low, mid, high.
low â†’ for 0s
mid â†’ for current element
high â†’ for 2s
